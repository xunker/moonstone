Hands-free flashlight for forearm crutches

A flashlight that mounts inside the handle of several brands/models of forearm-style (aka "Canadian") crutches. Just like headlights on a car, this allows the user to see where they are going in the dark without having to hold a flashlight -- something that's hard to do if your hands are already busy holding your crutches!
